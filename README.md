# CS280 Data Structures

## Description
Exercises in implementing and understanding abstract data types including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and graphs.

## Individual Projects
* Water Ret - Determine water retention of a 2D array of heights by implementing a queue to simulate a cascading effect of escaping water.
* Kruskal - Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm using disjoint sets.
* OA Hash Table - Open-addressing hash table that uses both linear probing and double hashing to resolve collisions.
* AVL - Expansion of BST to an AVL tree that self-balances by using rotations and balance calculations.
* BST - Binary search tree implementation with functions for inserting, finding, deleting, moving, copying, and assigning elements.
* Rummikub - Solve a game of Rummikub given a collection of tiles by recursively trying different legal options for runs and groups.
* Lariat - Store small segments of contiguous memory non-contiguously in order to insert elements into a "linked list of arrays" effeciently.
* Object Allocator - Memory management system that applies linked list techniques for allocating and deallocating fixed-size memory blocks for a client.
