Implement Kruskal algorithm using disjoint sets.

Roadmap: 
1) implement disjoint sets (files disjoint_sets.h and disjoint_sets.cpp)
Test using driver tests 0,...,10. Expected time - immediate.

2) implement Kruskal algorithm (file kruskal.h) using disjoint sets.
All tests should be immediate, except
test16  0.2 seconds
test17  2   seconds

Note on test17:
this is a "(very) small world" graph with 1,000,000 vertices.
If you used "colors" instead of disjoint subsets in Kruskal implementation, 
test17 will take forever. This is why this test will cost 30 points.

tests 11,...,16 read graph from file.
For tests 11,...,14 the files are available in 3 formats:
g?          - the actual file that is read
g?.dot      - dot-file
g?.dot.pdf  - pdf generated from the above dot-file (for debugging?)

Submit:
kruskal.h (no kruskal.cpp, so implementation goes into the header)
disjoint_sets.h
disjoint_sets.cpp
